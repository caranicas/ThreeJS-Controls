#### UMD Ports of Three JS Controls to facilitate inclusion through [Bower](http://bower.io/)

The purpose of the library is to enable a more modern work flow for web sites that feature [three.js](http://threejs.org/) and want to use one of the allready developed controls; Using Bower to manage your controls as a component, instead of having to have scripts loose in the top of html.
